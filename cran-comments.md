Dear 'CRAN',

I'm pleased to submit my re-revisions of the 'virtuoso' package to 'CRAN.' 

I've now removed the documentation & examples for the unexported function, vos_clear_graph(),
and I have added single quotes around software names and 'API' names as requested.  

- I confirm that I have read and agree to the 'CRAN' policies.
- I affirm that the package only writes to locations that the user specifies.  
- I have avoided the dontrun tests, using donttest where examples may take longer than 5 seconds, 
  while allowing other tests to run where appropriate.
- Now every function includes an example in the documentation. 

My apologies for these issues and thanks for your patience and your service to our community!

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
